In this repository I am uploading a real life project scenario offered by Goldman Sachs.

There were few tasks which were given to me regarding the project which needs to be solved with the helpn of Microsoft Excel.

After Solving the basic problems i had to come up with certain insights which i tried to put up in the form of charts.

I will be attaching few files about each task and my output i.e how i processed everything.

I will attach the excel files too , so you can download them and practice on your own.
